level_source_model:<INT Index>,<String /Modelfile>,<FLOAT TranslationX>:<FLOAT - Y>:<FLOAT Z>,<FLOAT Rotation>:<X>:<Y>:<Z>
level_destination_model::<INT Index>,<String /Modelfile>,<FLOAT TranslationX>:<FLOAT - Y>:<FLOAT Z>,<FLOAT Rotation>:<X>:<Y>:<Z>

These define the sources from which the targets leave and travel to, 
the first int is the index, it is used to index the target and destination objects in their coresponding hashtable, 
the second arg, is a string starting with a / which define the model to load from the res, must be an m3g file with a single object, the model.
the third argument, is 3 floats seperated by a : in the form n:n:n which define the position of the model on the level,
the fourth is the rotation, 4 floats in the form n:n:n:n is not yet implemented, but will be angle:x:y:z
