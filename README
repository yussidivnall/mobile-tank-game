Work in progress, aims to be the best game ever concieved on a mobile phone.
Ok not, aims to be a pretty fun game


This is actually called TGame2, the easiest way I found to run it is in the WTK apps directory, create TGame2 either as a link to mobile-tank-game, or as a directory with the contents of mobile-tank-game/

to run with WTK on *nix:
link called TGame2 from mobile-tank-game to WTK2.x.x/apps/
so: ln -s /PATH/mobile-tank-game PATH_TO_WTK2.x.x/apps/TGame2
then KToolbar and open TGame2

or

mkdir PATH_TO_WTK2.x.x/apps/TGame2
cp -r /PATH/mobile-tank-game/* PATH_TO_WTK2.x.x/apps/TGame2/
ktoolbar
and open TGame2
